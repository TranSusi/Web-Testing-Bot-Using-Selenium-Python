Task 2 Create the Python Test Fixture with Selenium to load the driver and c
Access the Web Page

1.	Python Test Fixture is called before and after each test.
2.	Waits for the page to load with explicit wait
3.	Loads the Firefox Driver into Selenium Web Driver

Task 3: Use the Pytest test framework with Selenium to Test Web Page Traversal
1.	Generator: Yield the Driver to the Test.
2.	Locate the element using the button text.
3.	Click the button using a selenium driver function.
4.	Check the page title.
5.	Observe the website load and change page


Next:
Now we will test and debug with Python. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:
•	Create the virtual environment and install Selenium, Pytest, and Firefox driver.
•	Create the Python Test Fixture with Selenium to load the driver and access the Web Page. 
•	Use the Pytest test framework with Selenium to Test Web Page Traversal. 
•	Check the links on the WebPage for valid Hypertext References with Selenium.
•	Use Selenium and Pytest to check the form submission process.



Task 4: Check the links on the WebPage for valid Hypertext References with Selenium
1.	Use the find elements by tag names to gather anchor elements into an array
2.	For each anchor tag, extract the href attribute
3.	Compare the href to a list of acceptable ‘partial phrases in the href.
4.	Use assertion to check hrefs with pytest


Task 5: Use Selenium and Pytest to check the form submission process.
1.	Click on the ‘Get an account’ button programmatically
2.	Explicitly wait for the page to loa
3.	Obtain the input element by tag name
4.	Use the send keys function to set the email in the input field.
5.	Press the submit button programmatically
6.	Check the email entered using pytest assertion.


Practice at the basic level from target a to f and took note what I can not do, what I like most.

Things are not done completely is that I can not run the model by myself because of the big amount of data. Therefore, the visualization is not valuable.
5.	Improvement:

- Stronger laptop to train data by myself, then make good visualization
- Study more about the above technologies used and how to use them frequently.
